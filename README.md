# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Business Central Projects

This file contains my custom GitHub Copilot instructions for Dynamics 365 Business Central projects. These guidelines help maintain consistent coding standards and follow best practices in AL development.

## Note: Work in Progress

This configuration is currently under testing and needs further refinement. Some instructions may change as we continue to optimize the development workflow.

## Installation

To use these instructions:
1. Create a `.github` folder at the root of your project (at the same level as your `.app` folder)
2. Save this file as `copilot-instructions.md` inside that folder

## Benefits

- Consistent code generation following AL standards
- Improved code documentation
- Uniform format for commits and pull requests
- Reduction of common errors in BC development

## Content

The configuration includes instructions for:
- AL code generation following best practices
- Code review process
- Commit message formatting
- Pull request titles and descriptions

## Note

These instructions customize GitHub Copilot's behavior when integrated with your editor. For best results, ensure you have the GitHub Copilot extension properly installed and configured in your development environment.
